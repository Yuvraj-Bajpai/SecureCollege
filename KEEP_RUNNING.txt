⚠️ IMPORTANT: KEEP THE BATCH FILE WINDOW OPEN ⚠️

When you run START_DEV_SERVER.bat:
- A black window will open
- DO NOT CLOSE IT
- The website needs this window to keep running
- Closing the window stops the website

This is how development servers work - they must stay running!

To stop the server:
1. Switch to the black window
2. Press Ctrl+C
3. Then close the window

If you need the website running 24/7, consider using a production build:
  npm run build
  npm start

But for development, you MUST keep the batch window open!
